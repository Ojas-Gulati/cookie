# cookie
Cookie is a short, simple and succinct programming language. (Right now, it's work in progress)

# Get started!
Cookie is Node driven, and it works like this (as of March 2016):

1. Place your program in program.txt.
2. Place any arguments in args.txt.
3. Run by typing into the console `node cookie.js`
4. The output will be in output.txt.
